On the left you wil see a settings menu that allows you to edit the type of questions that you will be asked. For example which types of verbs do you want to focus, which conjugation tense, which pronouns do you want to include and so on (Selections will be randomized by each category). Aswell as What CEFR(Common European Framework) Level and length of the response.

Once the User starts, it will generate a random question with the question initially hidden, to hear the question the user would click the headphone button.

If the user ever needs to read the question, they can always uncheck it and if they don't know the translation of a specific word they can select that word/phrase to see it's translation.

Once the user has an idea of what they want to say to respond to the question, they press the microphone button once to start recording. When it turns red it means it's recording, press it again to stop. Once finished you'd press continue button to carry on to the next step. If you are not satisfied with you're response, you can always press the record button again to try again.
